1. Models: Define calss and properties;
2. Controllers: Define the action (call which View) after receiving request;
3. View: Define the contents that show up;

Q1: The class in Models was called in View without specofying the name, what if there are several classes in Models?
    在View中call出Models中的类，只需在开头“@ProjectName.Models.ClassName"，若Models中有多个类，怎么防止混淆？
    
Q2: Pay attention to the RouteConfig strcture, such as:  url: "{controller}/{action}/{id}".
    注意RouteConfig的结构，如：url: "{controller}/{action}/{id}"。
